To change the number of windows opened, change the y value.
To mess with the random positions area just modify the second value of randint to whatever you want (just make sure that it's not outside your screen resolution).
To change the video name just replace video.mp4 to the file of your choosing.
To close all the windows press q.
Enjoy ;)
